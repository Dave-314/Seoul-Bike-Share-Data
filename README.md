# Seoul-Bike-Share-Data
Predict number of bikes rented based on time and weather data

This project utilizes data management, visualization and analysis.

Data Management - transform, combine, create new variables based on existing ones.
Data Visiualization - visualize distributions or trends in data and plot regression predictions in order to see how the model performed.
Data Analysis - Every step from start to finish. Multiple regression models are fit to the data and undergo hyper-parameter tuning to get the most accurate predictions.
This project used Logistic Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and Explainable Boosting Regressor to achieve an R^2 score of 0.97 on the test dataset.

If there are any questions, constructive criticism on how this project was done feel free to contact me. I am always looking to learn something new.
